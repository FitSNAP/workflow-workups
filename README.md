# workflow-workups
Collaborative repo for testing early-stage workflow ideas for FitSNAP/fitting MLIAPs.

## For users
You may need to have FitSNAP installed as a library to use some of these scripts.

## For contributors
The goal is to keep this repo as low-key and informal as possible!

Only two requests: 
* For each "idea" you push here, please make it a new directory to keep the main trunk clutter free.
* Try to keep file sizes low-ish wherever possible, to make cloning easy for folks.

Thanks! - Meg
